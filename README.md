# SystemMonitor
Threat detection/System Monitoring software The project aims to utilize CPU monitoring for threat detection against malicious processes and activities by continuously monitoring the CPU usage across the system, when anomalies are detected, such processes would get flagged for further investigation, either done manually or by the software. When done by the software it would compare the process in suspicion to a database such as virus total’s database for IoC’s which could include known malicious IP addresses, malware files, etc. Another feature of the software would be analyzing the systems network traffic, by displaying current open ports within the system, as well as discovering devices on the same network with their ports and information gathered through the scans such as devices names. It would also include a map that would display the live feed traffic for the system based on IP Geolocation to investigate traffic location for potential man in the middle attacks. The software would also utilize scripts written to investigate known issues and vulnerabilities within the system; such scripts would run in the background and give the user recommendations on how to harden the device. In summary the overall aim for the software is to be a one stop dashboard application for an everyday joe to utilize and asses their own systems defense and safety.
